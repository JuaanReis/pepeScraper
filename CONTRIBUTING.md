## Versioning
This will follow a rule with this pattern:
    MAJOR.MINIOR.PATH<w>
    
> _Explain_
```
    MAJOR (n1)
        Major number. Incremented when changes  occur that are incompatible with previous    versions or significant structural changes to the project.

    MINOR (n2)
        Minor number. Incremented when new features are added in a backwards-compatible manner.

    PATCH (n3)
        Patch number. Incremented when bugs are fixed or minor improvements are introduced, with no impact on compatibility     or new features.
```

### Series letter:
```
    <a> alpha "unstable"
    <b> beta "contains bugs"
    <rc> release candidate "final adjustments"
    <> stable
```
### Example:
```
    1.0.0rc1
```
